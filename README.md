# Image-Classification-using-PCA-and-CNN

The objective of this project is to develop an image classification system capable of accurately distinguishing between images of circles and triangles. Leveraging original images created in graphic software and employing image augmentation techniques, the project aims to build a diverse and augmented dataset. The application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) serves to reduce the dimensionality of the images while retaining essential features. Subsequently, a machine learning classifier is trained on the reduced-dimensional representations to achieve effective classification. The choice of classifier, is kept as SVC but any other clarrifier could work. Through systematic training, evaluation, and interpretation, the project seeks to produce a reliable and interpretable model for image classification.
